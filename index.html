			<h2>History of McDonald</h2>
			<p>McDonald's is an American multinational fast food corporation, founded in 1940 as a restaurant
				operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They
				rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise,
				with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955,
				Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the
				chain from the McDonald brothers.
